        <h2>Adventure in the Jungle</h2>
        <p>A tropical jungle is an awesome place. I had the opportunity of visiting one recently.My friend Rahim, who
            works as a forest ranger, took me along on one of his trips into the jungle. I had wanted to experience for
            myself first-hand what he had always spoken about.<br><br>The moment we entered the jungle, a sort of
            semi-darkness
            enveloped us. The sky was almost completely shut out by the canopy of leaves high above us. At ground level,
            thick vegetation grew in every direction. The air was damp and had a peculiar smell to it.All around us were
            the sounds of insects, birds and animals. Though we could not see them, except for some birds, we knew they
            were there. The sounds echoed all over, making the jungle feel eerie and strange.I had no idea how Rahim
            could find a way through the bushes and trees. He said he was just following a path used by the aborigines.
            As far as I was concerned, I could not see any path.<br><br> I realised then how easily an inexperienced
            person
            could get lost and perish in the jungle.Nevertheless I followed Rahim as we trudged along slowly. The most
            uncomfortable thing about being in the jungle were the leeches. These little bloodsuckers never gave up.
            Despite thick boots and clothes, they still managed to bite me.For the first time in my life I saw strange
            birds, insects, huge spiders, snakes, trees, flowers, vines as thick as a man's hand and various animals.
